# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), with TypeScript template.

## To run locally

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Bonus

Wired up the start free trial form.  Used a simple email regex for validation and added Apollo to make the createUser mutation request.
